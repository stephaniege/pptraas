Notes:
- I used Compass for CSS because it makes my life way easier. http://compass-style.org/
	- It basically uses SASS (a CSS preprocessor) and a bunch of sweet mixins/etc to write much neater CSS, but it means that you have to render out the CSS.
	- Or you can just ignore my SASSy goodness, abandon it, and just edit the CSS directly. But if anyone renders the SASS files out, it'll overwrite any changes made directly in the CSS files. Just a warning!
- I started trying to put in some gesture support but, long story short, while I got it to recognize the gestures, I couldn't get it to behave the way I wanted. I commented out the code.
